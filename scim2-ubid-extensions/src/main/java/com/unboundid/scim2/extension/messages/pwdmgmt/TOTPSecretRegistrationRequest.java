/**
 * This class provides the request and response model for the TOTP shared secret
 * SCIM sub-resource handler that may be used to register a new randomly
 * generated TOTP shared secret for a user.
 * <br><br>
 * To generate a new TOTP shared secret, create a new, empty request using POST.
 * The response will include the generated shared secret, the corresponding
 * otpauth URI which may be used to generate a QR code to be scanned by the
 * TOTP device. The shared secret is not yet saved to the user resource at this
 * time. To prove that the generated shared secret is correctly added to the
 * TOTP device, a valid TOTP generated by the TOTP device must then be sent in
 * a PUT request along with the internal verify state value received during the
 * previous POST response. If the TOTP is successfully validated, the generated
 * shared secret will then be saved to the user resource and ready for use.
