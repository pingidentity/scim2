<p>This package contains client classes for building SCIM 2 requests and for
    accessing resources from SCIM 2 service providers.</p>

<p>The most important of these is the
    {@link com.unboundid.scim2.client.ScimService} class, which is the
    main entry point for the SCIM 2 client API. This class provides methods for
    accessing a SCIM 2 service provider's resources, configuration, schemas,
    and resource types.</p>
