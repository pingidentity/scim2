        interface for accessing attributes of any SCIM resource.</li>
    <li>The {@link Path} class, which is used to specify the targets of SCIM
        PATCH operations or to specify attributes to retrieve or modify when
        manipulating resources through the {@link GenericScimResource} class.</li>
    <li>The {@link Filter} class and related classes, used to build SCIM 2
        query filters.</li>
