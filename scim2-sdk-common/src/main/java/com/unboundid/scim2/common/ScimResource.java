/**
 * This class represents the core interface for all SCIM objects. This interface
 * helps ensure that all SCIM resources contain the following properties:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A {@code schemas} field containing a list of URIs that represent the
 *        type of the SCIM resource.
 *   <li> An {@code id} field representing a unique identifier for the resource.
 *        This is typically in {@link java.util.UUID} form.
 *   <li> A {@link Meta} attribute that stores metadata relating to the SCIM
 *        resource, such as the time the resource was created and last updated.
 *   <li> An {@code externalID} field. This is an optional field whose meaning
 *        is determined by a SCIM client. This is particularly useful for
 *        provisioning use cases, where a client is importing users from another
 *        system but still wants to store a resource's old unique ID in the new
 *        system. The {@code externalID} field can later be used by the client
 *        to search for resources on the new SCIM endpoints by referencing their
 *        old IDs.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The SCIM SDK provides two core implementations of ScimResource. These are the
 * {@link BaseScimResource} and {@link GenericScimResource} classes. In general,
 * a SCIM resource should be represented as a BaseScimResource if a well-defined
 * schema is known ahead of time, and a dedicated Java object is desired.
 * Alternatively, a SCIM resource should be represented as a GenericScimResource
 * if it is easier to work with a class that is a wrapper for a JSON object.
 * See the class-level documentation of these subclasses for more information.
