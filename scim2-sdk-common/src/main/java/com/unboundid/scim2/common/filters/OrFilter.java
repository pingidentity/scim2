/**
 * This class represents a SCIM {@code or} filter. An OR filter allows
 * a client to specify multiple filter criteria, where at least one of the
 * criteria must match.
 * <br><br>
 * For instance, consider the following filter. Parentheses have been added for
 * clarity.
 * <pre>
 *   (name.familyName sw "Sa") or (nickName sw "Sa")
 * </pre>
 * This is a filter with two components: a {@code sw} filter that matches SCIM
 * resources with a {@code familyName} starting with {@code "Sa"}, and another
 * {@code sw} filter that matches resources with a {@code nickName} starting
 * with "Sa". As an example, this filter would match a resource whose
 * {@code name.familyName} is {@code "Neighbors"} and has a {@code nickName} of
 * {@code "Sails"}.
 * <br><br>
 * This example filter can be represented with the following Java code:
 * <pre>
 *   Filter orFilter = Filter.or(
 *           Filter.sw("name.familyName", "Sa"),
 *           Filter.sw("nickName", "Sa")
 *   );
 * </pre>
 * A SCIM resource will match an OR filter if one of its subordinate filters
 * (also referred to as "filter components") match the resource.
 * <br><br>
 * This class allows for the use of multiple filter components, but {@code or}
 * filters generally only have two components.
