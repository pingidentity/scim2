/**
 * This class represents a SCIM exception pertaining to the
 * {@code HTTP 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED} error response code. This exception type
 * should be thrown when a client sends a request to a valid endpoint, but
 * provides an unsupported REST method (e.g., {@code GET}, {@code POST}).
 * <br><br>
 * The following is an example of a MethodNotAllowedException as seen by a SCIM
 * client.
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error" ],
 *     "status": "405",
 *     "detail": "The /.search endpoint only supports POST requests."
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The MethodNotAllowedException in the above example can be created with the
 * following Java code:
 * <pre>
 *   throw new MethodNotAllowedException(
 *           "The /.search endpoint only supports POST requests.");
 * </pre>
 *
 * This exception type generally does not have a {@code scimType} value.
