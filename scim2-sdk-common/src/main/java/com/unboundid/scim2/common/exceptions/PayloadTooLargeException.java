/**
 * This class represents a SCIM exception pertaining to the {@code HTTP 413}
 * error response code. This exception type should be thrown when a client sends
 * a request with a JSON body that exceeds the threshold for an acceptable
 * payload size. This is most likely to occur when processing bulk operations
 * that contain many different requests, but can also occur for other general
 * endpoints.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * The following is an example of a PayloadTooLargeException presented to a
 * SCIM client:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error" ],
 *   "status": "413",
 *   "detail": "The size of the request exceeds the maxPayloadSize (1048576)."
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * To create the above error as an exception, use the following Java code:
 * <pre><code>
 *   throw new PayloadTooLargeException(
 *       "The size of the request exceeds the maxPayloadSize (1048576)."
 *   );
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This exception should never have a {@code scimType}.
