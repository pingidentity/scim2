/**
 * This class represents a SCIM exception pertaining to the
 * {@code HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN} error response code. This exception type should be
 * thrown when a client provides valid credentials, but attempts an operation
 * that they are not authorized to use. This error indicates that the client has
 * insufficient access rights, or that the operation is not permitted by the
 * service provider.
 * <br><br>
 * The following is an example of a ForbiddenException presented to a SCIM
 * client.
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error" ],
 *     "status": "403",
 *     "detail": "You do not have access to this resource."
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The ForbiddenException in the above example can be created with the following
 * Java code:
 * <pre>
 *   throw new ForbiddenException("You do not have access to this resource.");
 * </pre>
 *
 * This exception type generally does not have a {@code scimType} value.
