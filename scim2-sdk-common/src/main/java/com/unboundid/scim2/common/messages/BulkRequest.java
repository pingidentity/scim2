/**
 * This class represents a SCIM 2 bulk request as described by
 * <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.7">
 * RFC 7644 Section 3.7</a>.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Bulk requests are a type of operation that allow a client to perform multiple
 * write requests within a single API call. Bulk requests are comprised of a
 * list of {@link BulkOperation} objects, where each bulk operation represents a
 * single write request. When a client sends a bulk request to a SCIM service,
 * the service will respond with a {@link BulkResponse}.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * As an example, consider the following bulk request that creates two users:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:BulkRequest" ],
 *   "failOnErrors": 1,
 *   "Operations": [
 *     {
 *       "method": "POST",
 *       "path": "/Users",
 *       "data": {
 *         "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User" ],
 *         "userName": "Alice"
 *       }
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "method": "POST",
 *       "path": "/Users",
 *       "data": {
 *         "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User" ],
 *         "userName": "Bob"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * As seen above, bulk requests contain the following fields:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> {@code failOnErrors}: An optional integer that specifies a threshold
 *        for the amount of acceptable errors. If this field is not set, then
 *        the SCIM service will attempt to fulfill as many operations as it can.
 *        // TODO: Clarify the threshold comment, and to check the API docs
 *   <li> {@code Operations}: The list of {@link BulkOperation} requests that
 *        represent all of the write requests contained in this API call.
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 *
 * To construct the above bulk request, use the following Java code:
 * <pre><code>
 *  BulkRequest request = new BulkRequest(
 *        BulkOperation.post("/Users", new UserResource().setUserName("Alice")),
 *        BulkOperation.post("/Users", new UserResource().setUserName("Bob"))
 *  );
 *  request.setFailOnErrors(1);
 *
 *  // Use this method when the arguments are already contained in a list.
 *  BulkRequest request = new BulkRequest(getBulkOperationList(), 1);
 * </code></pre>
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Note that it is possible to iterate over the bulk operations by iterating
 * over the bulk request object itself.
 * <pre><code>
 *   for (BulkOperation operation : bulkRequest)
 *   {
 *     // Perform some action with the operation.
 *   }
 *
 *   // TODO: Write a test case to make sure this is true
 *   // forEach() can also be used, but this is not recommended because it can
 *   // cause difficulties with debugging or following stack traces.
 *   bulkRequest.forEach(op -> System.out.println(op));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Some additional background about bulk requests and how SCIM services may
 * process them are shared below:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The order of the bulk operations are not guaranteed to be processed
 *        in order. Specifically, RFC 7644 states that "[a] SCIM service
 *        provider MAY elect to optimize the sequence of operations received
 *        (e.g., to improve processing performance)." When doing so, the
 *        service... MUST ensure that the clientâ€™s intent is preserved
 *        and the same stateful result is achieved..."
 *   <li> By default, RFC 7644 states that SCIM services "MUST continue
 *        performing as many changes as possible and disregard partial
 *        failures". In other words, bulk requests must attempt to process as
 *        many of the bulk operations as possible, even if failures occur for
 *        some of the bulk operations. As sated above, clients may override this
 *        behavior by setting the {@code failOnErrors} field.
 *   <li> Bulk operations are not atomic. Successful updates will always be
 *        applied until the optional {@code failOnErrors} threshold is reached.
 *   <li> It is important to be careful about payload size restrictions when
 *        sending bulk requests to a SCIM service. Be prepared to handle
 *        {@link PayloadTooLargeException} errors.
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * TODO: Add tests serializing bulk requests and bulk operations.
 * TODO: Test iterating over the object
