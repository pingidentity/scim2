/**
 * This class represents a SCIM exception pertaining to the
 * {@code HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED} error response code. This exception type should
 * be thrown when a client provides an invalid or missing authorization header
 * in the request. This error most commonly occurs when a client does not have a
 * valid bearer token for their SCIM request.
 * <br><br>
 * The following is an example of an UnauthorizedException presented to a SCIM
 * client. This example error response indicates that the client request was
 * denied due to insufficient access rights.
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error" ],
 *     "status": "401",
 *     "detail": "The client is not authorized to perform the operation."
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The UnauthorizedException in the above example can be created with the
 * following Java code:
 * <pre>
 *   throw new UnauthorizedException(
 *           "The client is not authorized to perform the operation.");
 * </pre>
 *
 * This exception type generally does not have a {@code scimType} value.
